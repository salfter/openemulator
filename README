Mac OS X
========

  Before compiling the OpenEmulator XCode project under Mac OS X, you need
libzip and libportaudio. The easiest way to accomplish this is to
install MacPorts. If you are under Snow Leopard, enter the following commands:

  sudo port install libzip +universal configure.universal_cflags="-arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" configure.universal_ldflags="-arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64"

  sudo port install portaudio +universal configure.universal_cflags="-arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" configure.universal_ldflags="-arch ppc -arch i386 -arch x86_64"

  Otherwise, try:

  sudo port install libzip +universal
  sudo port install portaudio +universal
