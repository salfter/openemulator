============

  This is OpenEmulator, a cross-platform emulator of many legacy computer
systems.

  For more information, take a look at the included man pages. Try
openemulator(3).

  For generic installation instructions, see file 'INSTALL'. Just in case,
you should have libxml2, libzip and libportaudio available. If you don't
have apt-get powers, you can find them at these websites:

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the

Mac OS X
========

  Before compiling the OpenEmulator XCode project under Mac OS X, you need
libzip and libportaudio. The easiest way to accomplish this is to
install MacPorts.

  If you want to build universal binaries, you should edit the file
/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf, and change the "universal_archs"
entry to the following:

universal_archs		x86_64 i386 ppc

  The next step is installing required libraries:

  sudo port install libzip +universal
  sudo port install portaudio +universal
  sudo port install libsndfile +universal
  sudo port install libsamplerate +universal
