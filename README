============

  This is OpenEmulator, a cross-platform emulator of many legacy computer
systems.

  For more information, take a look at the included man pages. Try

requires these external libraries:
 
* libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org)
* libzip (http://www.nih.at/libzip)
* portaudio (http://www.portaudio.com)
* libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile)

Mac OS X
========

  In order to compile the OpenEmulator XCode project under Mac OS X, you
need some external libraries not available on a default Mac OS X
installation. The easiest way to install them is through MacPorts.

  If you want to build universal binaries, edit the file
/opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf, and change the "universal_archs"
entry to the following:

universal_archs		x86_64 i386 ppc

  The next step is installing the required libraries:

  sudo port install libzip +universal
  sudo port install portaudio +universal
  sudo port install libsndfile +universal
  sudo port install libsamplerate +universal
