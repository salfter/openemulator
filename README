OpenEmulator
============

This is OpenEmulator, a cross-platform emulator of many legacy computer
systems.

For more information, take a look at the included documentation.

For generic installation instructions, see file 'INSTALL'. OpenEmulator
requires these external libraries:

* libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org/)
* libzip (http://www.nih.at/libzip/)
* libpng (http://www.libpng.org/)
* portaudio (http://www.portaudio.com/)
* libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
* libsamplerate (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/)

If you make a binary distribution, include a pointer to the official
distribution site:

	http://www.openemulator.org/

The latest version can always be found there.

Mail suggestions and bug reports to <mressl@umich.edu>.


Linux
=====

Important: the user-interface has not yet been implemented. For now
you can only build the libemulation library.

Installation of libraries depends on the Linux distribution.

If you have a Debian-compatible distribution, try the following
commands:

sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libzip-dev
sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
sudo apt-get install libsamplerate1-dev


Mac OS X
========

To compile OpenEmulator for Mac OS X you need Xcode and several
external libraries not available by default. The easiest way to install
them is through MacPorts:

	http://www.macports.org/

Download and install MacPorts.

To produce binaries that work with older versions of Mac OS X, enter the
following command at the terminal:

sudo nano /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf

Add at the end of this file (if you installed an older Xcode,
change the path of MacOSX10.6.sdk accordingly):

universal_target        10.6
universal_sysroot       /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk

Then try the following commands:

sudo port install libzip +universal
sudo port install libpng +universal
sudo port install portaudio +universal
sudo port install libsndfile +universal
sudo port install libsamplerate +universal

If you can't compile because of this error: "'zipconf.h' file not found", try:

sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libzip/include/zipconf.h /opt/local/include/zipconf.h
