Linux
=====

  Installation of libraries depends on the Linux distribution.

  If you have a Debian-compatible distribution, try the following
commands:

  sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libzip-dev
  sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsamplerate1-dev
  sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev

Mac OS X
========

  In order to compile the OpenEmulator XCode project under Mac OS X you
need some external libraries not available on a default Mac OS X
installation. The easiest way to install them is through MacPorts:

  Download and install, then install these libraries:

  sudo port install libzip +universal
  sudo port install portaudio +universal
  sudo port install libsndfile +universal
  sudo port install libsamplerate +universal
  sudo port install libpng +universal
