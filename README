OpenEmulator
============

  This is OpenEmulator, a cross-platform emulator of many legacy computer
systems.

  For more information, take a look at the included man pages. Try
oecli(3).

  For generic installation instructions, see file 'INSTALL'. OpenEmulator
requires these external libraries:
 
* libxml2 (http://www.xmlsoft.org/)
* libzip (http://www.nih.at/libzip/)
* libpng (http://www.libpng.org/)
* portaudio (http://www.portaudio.com/)
* libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
* libsamplerate (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/)

  If you make a binary distribution, include a pointer to the official
distribution site:

The latest version can always be found there.

Linux
=====

  Installation of libraries depends on the Linux distribution.

  If you have a Debian-compatible distribution, try the following
commands:

  sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
  sudo apt-get install libzip-dev
  sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev
  sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
  sudo apt-get install libsamplerate1-dev

Mac OS X
========

  To compile OpenEmulator for Mac OS X you need XCode, and several
external libraries not available by default. The easiest way to install
them is through MacPorts:

  http://www.macports.org/

  Download and install MacPorts, then try the following commands:

  sudo port install libzip +universal
  sudo port install libpng +universal
  sudo port install portaudio +universal
  sudo port install libsndfile +universal
  sudo port install libsamplerate +universal

  To produce binaries that work with Mac OS X 10.6, edit macports.conf
and add:

  universal_target        10.6
  universal_sysroot       /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk
