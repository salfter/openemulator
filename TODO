==To-Do==
* Implement AudioCodec
* Implement screen persistance with IIR filtering
* Fix opening emulations (sometimes dragging disk images to canvas opens the template chooser)
* Fix Cocoa initial window sizes
* Implement automatic software update

* Optimize MOS6502 and W65C02S special condition handling
* Refactor PAAudio
* Implement Apple II
* Implement Apple IIplus
* Implement Apple IIj-plus
* Implement Apple Language Card
* Implement Saturn RAMboard
* Implement SoundPlayer
* Implement Apple Disk II Interface Card
* Implement Apple Disk II
* Implement Videx Videoterm

* Implement Apple IIe
* Implement Apple II Memory Expansion Card
* Implement AE RamWorks
* Implement Mountain Computer Apple Clock
* Implement TimeMaster II H.O.
* Implement Thunderclock Plus
* Implement ZIP Chip
* Implement AE TransWarp
* Implement Microsoft Softcard
* Implement Apple Silentype Interface Card
* Implement Apple Silentype

* Implement Apple IIc FF
* Implement Apple IIc 00
* Implement Apple IIc 01
* Implement Apple IIc 03
* Implement Apple IIc plus

* Implement Digisector DS-65

* Implement select settings with values and labels
* Add OESound: resampling, rendering to audio buffer
* Implement UNICODE entry of composed keys on Mac OS X (like ^ or « or `)
* Fix [CanvasView update] problem in paper view
* Remove data property, and replace with value so that it points to the file (so the interface for opening files is unified, and we don't have to exchange buffers). Implement an OEData class that is capable of read from/writing to file. How could OEData get the handle to a zip package?
* Do disk image file locking, if the disk image is writable (flock)
* Fix scrolling in template chooser when changing group
* CanvasWindow in fullscreen mode could have multiple display sizes (e.g. for the Macintosh 512x342 window)
* TCP AT Modem emulation
* Add debugging ˆ la JTAG with gdb commands in a separate terminal
* Implement a CPU Load Window
* Add search in template chooser
